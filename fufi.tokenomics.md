`FuFi Tokenomics`

# FuFi Token Profile

- Total supply: `10 billion`
- Symbol code: `$FFT`
- Precision: 18 on EVM chains and 4 on `Galaxy` chain

# FuFi Tokens on multiple blockchains

`$FFT` will be solely issued as as ERC20 token on Ethereum network for its pervasive ecosystem adoption. However, in order to serve its utility and governance token in FuFi protocols, `$FFT` must be bridged over from Ethereum to [Galaxy Chain](https://gax.network) via a powerful cross-chain bridge: [MilkWay](https://milkway.io)

# Token Deflation & Mining with FuFi DEXs

In order to greatly encourage providing liquidity as well as trading in FuFi's spot and perpetual markets, both makers and traders will be rewarded in different manners:

- `Stake2Earn(S2E)`: `10%` of taker-side trading fees will go to `$FFT` staking pool for users to share the fees;
- `Hold2Earn(H2E)`: `20%` of taker-side trading fees will go to `$FFT` burn pool so as to buyback & burn `$FFT` Tokens;
- `Make2Earn(M2E)`: `30%` of taker-side trading fees will go to the maker's account as reward for providing liquidity and zero fees charged to maker at all!
- `Trade2Earn(T2E)`: `40%` of taker-side trading fees will go to `$FFT` incentive pool to reward DEX takers provided that there are `$FFT` allocated for the current rewarding epoch. When there's no `$FFT` reward in the pool, the same amount will go to the DAO Treasure as DAO community development funds;
