`FuFi Tokenomics`

# FuFi Token Profile

- Total supply: `10 billion`
- Symbol code: `$FFT`
- Precision: 18 on EVM chains and 4 on `$AMAX` chain

# FuFi Tokens on multiple blockchains

For embracing fast and wide adoption of FuFi tokens by community users/investors worldwide, FuFi Token will be first issued on following blockchains and their corresponding deployed smart contract addresses are:
- Ethereum: `to-be-deployed`, amount: 5 billion
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC): `to-be-deployed`, amount: 5 billion

Then the tokens from the above two blockchains shall be fully bridged over to Armonia Meta Chain via its well-established [xChain](https://xchain.pro) bridge, in order to participate in FuFi protocols that also run ontop of Armonia Meta Chain.

Please double confirm the smart contract addresses with https://fufi.foundation for absolute accuracy!

# Token Deflation & Mining with FuFi DEXs

In order to greatly encourage providing liquidity as well as trading in FuFi's spot and perpetual markets, both makers and traders will be incentivized/rewarded in different manners:

- `Deflation`: `40%` of taker-side trading fees will go to `$FFT` burn pool so as to buyback & burn `$FFT` Tokens;
- `Trade2Earn`: `50%` of taker-side trading fees will go to `$FFT` incentive pool to reward DEX takers provided that there are `$FFT` allocated for the current rewarding epoch. When there's no `$FFT` reward in the pool, the same amount will go to the DAO Treasure as DAO community development funds;
- `Make2Earn`: `10%` of taker-side trading fees will go to the counterparty maker' account as reward for providing liquidity.
