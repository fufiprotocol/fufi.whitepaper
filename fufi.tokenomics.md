`FuFi Tokenomics`

# FuFi Token Profile

- Total supply: `10 billion`
- Symbol code: `$FFT`
- Precision: 18 on EVM chains and 4 on `$AMAX` chain

# FuFi Tokens on multiple blockchains

`$FFT` will be solely issued as as ERC20 token on Ethereum netowrk for its pervasive ecosystem adoption. However, in order to serve its utility and governance token in FuFi protocols, `$FFT` must be bridged over from Ethereum to [Armonia Meta Chain](https://amax.network) via her well-established [xChain](https://xchain.pro) bridge.

# Token Deflation & Mining with FuFi DEXs

In order to greatly encourage providing liquidity as well as trading in FuFi's spot and perpetual markets, both makers and traders will be incentivized/rewarded in different manners:

- `Deflation`: `40%` of taker-side trading fees will go to `$FFT` burn pool so as to buyback & burn `$FFT` Tokens;
- `Trade2Earn`: `50%` of taker-side trading fees will go to `$FFT` incentive pool to reward DEX takers provided that there are `$FFT` allocated for the current rewarding epoch. When there's no `$FFT` reward in the pool, the same amount will go to the DAO Treasure as DAO community development funds;
- `Make2Earn`: `10%` of taker-side trading fees will go to the counterparty maker' account as reward for providing liquidity and zero fees charged to maker at all!
